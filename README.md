This script is a Flask application that implements a simple portfolio tracker. The application has several routes, including '/', '/index/', '/register_page', '/login_page', '/login/' and '/portfolioOverview'.

The script starts by importing various modules such as 'flask', 'sqlite3', 'yfinance', 'plotly' and 'pandas'. A Flask application is created and a secret key is set for the application. A logger is also set up to log information about the application's usage.

The **get_asset_data()** and get_stock_markets() functions connect to a SQLite database called 'DataBase1.db', retrieve data from the 'assets' and 'stockMarket' tables respectively, and return the retrieved data.

The **index()** function is a route that renders the 'index.html' template and sets the title of the page as 'Portfolio Tracker'. The register1() function is another route that renders the 'register1.html' template and sets the title of the page as 'Register Page'.

The **CheckIfCorrectCredentials()** function takes two parameters 'loginName' and 'password' as input and checks whether the given loginName and password exist in the 'users' table of the 'DataBase1.db' database. It returns True if the given credentials are correct otherwise returns False.

The **login_page()** function is another route that renders the 'login.html' template and sets the title of the page as 'Login Page'. The login() function is a route that handles the login process. It gets the loginName and password from the request.form and checks if the provided credentials are correct using the CheckIfCorrectCredentials() function. If the credentials are correct, it redirects to '/portfolioOverview' else it renders the 'login.html' template with an error message.
